How to size memory, CPU, and disk for Neo4j in Kubernetes


In order to ensure that Neo4j is deployable on basic/default K8S clusters, the default values for hardware requests have been made fairly low, and can be found in https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-helm/blob/master/values.yaml[values.yaml].

Sizing databases is ultimately something that should be done with the workload in mind. Consult Neo4j's https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-performance-tuning/?ref=googlemarketplace[Performance Tuning Documentation] for more information. In general, heap size and page cache sizing are the most important places to start when tuning performance.

It is strongly recommended that you choose request and limit values for CPU and memory prior to deploying in important environments.
